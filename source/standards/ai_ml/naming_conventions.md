    <td>A mapping from labels to targets.<br><br>Why not a target to label map? In normal development flows, we start with labels and convert them to targets. Furthermore, label data types are typically strings while target data types are typically integers and, in some cases, lists. This allows us to specify the map using the actual data types that will be used.</td>
