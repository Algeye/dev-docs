## References

### Hyper-References

Often, one needs to refer to external links. Either strategically include an
embedded link in the text in the body of your document or add your link to a
'Links' section at the bottom of the document.

The following are examples of embedding the link into the text:

Testing is important according to the
[testing section of the Django documentation](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.2/topics/testing/)

pytest is much cleaner than Django according to

(An example from Wikipedia)

If you would rather not have the link within the text e.g. because a large part
of the document is based on the content from that link, as mentioned, you can
create a 'Links' section at the bottom of the document before the Bibliography
section (because, let's be honest, noone pays attention after reading the
heading 'Bibliography').

You will need to still use some form of title for the page to which the link is
pointing and embed the link into the text e.g.:
