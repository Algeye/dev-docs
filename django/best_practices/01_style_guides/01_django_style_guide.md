# Django Style Guide

## Semantics

<!--
- Not necessarily. Just ensure that you are referring to a class/model/object when you use the code name and are not using it as a noun otherwise it doesn't make sense and you will run into inconsistencies when things don't really fit.
- When referring to a class corresponding to a model, always follow the
  reference with 'object(s)' or model to be clear as the class name is neither natural
  language nor does it, necessarily, refer to the actual corresponding noun.
  Similarly, do not use the natural language name to refer to a class e.g.:

  (Good) A form for `ProductVariant` objects.

  (Bad) A form for a `ProductVariant`.

  (Good) A form for a product variant.

  (Bad) A form for product variant objects. -->
