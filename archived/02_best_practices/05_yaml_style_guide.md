# YAML Style Guide

YAML (1.2 specification) is an often-used language for configuration files in Peralex AI projects. Please ensure you follow the present style guide for YAML.

## Naming Convention

- Use the `.yaml` extension. The (rather sparse) YAML FAQ [recommends](http://www.yaml.org/faq.html) that you use `.yaml` in preference to .`yml`, but for historic reasons many Windows programmers are still scared of using extensions with more than three characters and so opt to use `.yml` instead.
- Arrange parameters in order of importance or order in which they will be used. If there is not particular importance order, arrange them in alphabetical order.
