  - Report template. Results table with details on splits (augmented) and the accuracies. Important to report training, validation and testing. Gives idea of capacity.

## Organisation

Always place all assets (i.e. images, plots, LaTex tables files, draw.io files
etc.) into appropriate subdirectories in the report root directory.

## Diagrams

Having tried out different diagraming tools such as PlantUML, Tikz, Mathcha and
draw.io, we recommend draw.io.
