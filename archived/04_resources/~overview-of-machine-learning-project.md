# Overview of Machine Learning Project

Before we begin, lets first have a look at some relevant terminology:
* **(Data/Machine Learning) Pipeline:** A sequence of data processing components. There is, quite often, a lot of data to manipulate and many data transformations to apply.

A prescribed workflow augmented to suit our needs is as follows:
1. Overview
2. Data Collection
3. Data Cleansing
3. Data Preprocessing
   1. Data Cleaning

## Data Cleansing
This is the process of fixing or removing incorrect, corrupted, incorrectly formatted, duplicate, or incomplete data within a dataset.
    
1. Define the problem.
2. Collect the data.
3. Explore the data to obtain insights.
4. Prepare the data to better expose the underlying data patterns to machine learning algorithms.
5. Explore many different models and shortlist the best ones.
6. Fine-tune your models and combine them into a solution.
7. Present your solution.
8. Launch/integrate, monitor and maintain your system.

## Define the Problem
Given a specific Machine Learning problem, there are two main questions to ask:
1. What kind of training supervision will the model need? Is it a supervised, unsupervised, semi-supervised, or reinforcement learning task?
2. Is it a classification task, a regression task, or something else? There are also different subcategories of the tasks e.g. multiple regression, univariate regression etc.
