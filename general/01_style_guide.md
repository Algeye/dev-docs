# General Style Guide

While each domain has its own styles which are defined on the pages listed
below, there are some style requirements that are more generally applicable,
discussed here.

## Naming Conventions

1. **Repository Naming:** All repositories must be lowercase with an underscore
   (NOT hyphen) separating words. Underscores are more user-friendly when it
   comes to importing repositories within another repositories e.g. with
   submodules.
